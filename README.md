# Lesson 0.6: MakeCode Arcade self-portrait

## Set the background.

Drag a ``||scene:set background color to ( )||`` into the ``||loops:on start||``
block.
Click on the grey oval to select a background color. After a moment you
should see the background change.

## Add a sprite.

In the Sprites catagory drag a
``||variables(sprites):set mySprite to||`` ``||sprites:sprite ( ) of kind player ||``
into the ``||loops:on start||``
block.

## Create your own sprite.

Click on the grey box in ``||sprites:sprite ( ) of kind player ||``.
Now draw a sprite that
represents yourself. It doesn't need to be perfect.
If you want a bigger sprite you can change the dimensions in the lower
left corner of the editor. Click on the big white X when you are done. You
should see your sprite.

## Say something.

Drag a
``||sprites:mySprite say ":)" +||`` block into the ``||loops:on start||``
block. Change the text ":)" to say something about yourself.
Click the + sign and change the time from 500 ms to 2000 ms.
Now right click that block and choose duplicate. Add two
more things about yourself.

## Move your sprite.

Drag a ``||Sprites:set mySprite position to x (0) y (0)||`` into the ``||loops:on start||``
block. Change 0 and 0 to a new position on the screen.

## Do what ever you want.

Try some different things. You could:
- Try making the sprite move.
- Add another sprite to represent your friend.
- Make the sprites talk when a button is pressed.
